# Thalamic-stim-connect

README
The code and data in this directory are a supplement to:

NM Gregg, G Ojeda Valencia, T Pridalova, H Huang, V Kremen, BN Lundstrom, JJ Van Gompel, KJ Miller, GA Worrell, D Hermes. “Thalamic stimulation induced changes in network connectivity and excitability in epilepsy.” 2024.

All code in this repository is written in MATLAB (Mathworks) and, together with the included data, can reproduce plots from the publication.

The code reproduces the plots from Main Figures 2 and 4, and Supplemental Table 2.
Code and data are provided as part of the goal of ensuring that computational methods are reproducible by other researchers.

** DEPENDENCIES **
Matlab toolboxes needed: 
System Identification Toolbox
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
